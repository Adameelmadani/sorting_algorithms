# Sorting algorithms & Big O

In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.

## Compilation

Compile using gcc

```bash
   gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic  -std=gnu89 ".c files " -o "output file name"
```

## Usage

To use these sorting algorithms in your own C projects, simply clone this repository and include the relevant header files in your code. Each algorithm is implemented as a separate function, and the function names are the same as the algorithm names.
