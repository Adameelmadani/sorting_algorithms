# Sorting Algorithm Repository

Welcome to my Sorting Algorithm Repository! Here, you can find implementations of various sorting algorithms in C.

## List of Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort - Hoare Partition scheme
- Heap Sort
- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort
- Bitonic Sort
- Cocktail Shaker Sort
- Shell Sort

## Usage

To use these sorting algorithms in your own C projects, simply clone this repository and include the relevant header files in your code. Each algorithm is implemented as a separate function, and the function names are the same as the algorithm names.
